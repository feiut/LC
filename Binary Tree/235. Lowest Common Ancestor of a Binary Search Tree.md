## Description:
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:

    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
## Solution:
Time: O(n)

Space: O(h)

For a given root, recursively call LCA(root.left, p, q) and LCA(root.right, p, q)

if both returns a valid node which means p, q are in different subtrees, then root will be their LCA.

if only one valid node returns, which means p, q are in the same subtree, return that valid node as their LCA.
