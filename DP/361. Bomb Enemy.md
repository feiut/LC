## Description
Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0' (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.
The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.

Example
Example1

Input:
grid =[
     "0E00",
     "E0WE",
     "0E00"
]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies
Example2

Input:
grid =[
     "0E00",
     "EEWE",
     "0E00"
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Placing a bomb at (0,0) or (0,3) or (2,0) or (2,3) kills 2 enemies
Notice
You can only put the bomb at an empty cell

## Solution
Time: O(MN), Space: O(MN)

Create a DP array for each direction to store the enemies killed in this direction. Repeat this operation for four times, then traverse the grid to find [i, j] that maximum `(fLeft[i][j] + fRight[i][j] + fUp[i][j] + fDown[i][j])`  

Note: Only empty cell can place bomb, otherwise if there is an enemy in the cell, it will be counted four times.
