## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

Note:
There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

## Solution:
### S1: Time: O(n^2), Space: O(n)
f[i] represents the length of LIS ended in nums[i].   
For each nums[i] traverse its previous numbers j, if `nums[j] < nums[i]`, update f[i] `f[i] = {f[i], f[j] + 1}`

### S2: Time: O(nlog(n)), Space: O(n)
Binary search, not DP.  
Index i is the length of Increasing Sequence, f[i] is the smallest ending number of the sequences which has a length of i.  
Update f[i] for each number and find the index with binary search. The incoming number should replace the first number which is equal or bigger than it. (so that  array f is always strictly increasing)


## Code:
### S1 Code:

    class Solution:

        // @param nums: An integer array
        // @return: The length of LIS (longest increasing subsequence)

        def longestIncreasingSubsequence(self, nums):
            // write your code here
            if len(nums) == 0:
                return 0
            f = [1 for _ in range(len(nums))]   #初始值需要是1，因为单个数字的Sequence长度是1
            f[0] = 1
            longest = f[0]
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                        f[i] = max(f[i], f[j] + 1)
                longest = max(f[i], longest)
            return longest


### S2 Code:

    class Solution:
        // @param nums: An integer array
        // @return: The length of LIS (longest increasing subsequence)
        def longestIncreasingSubsequence(self, nums):
            # write your code here
            if len(nums) == 0:
                return 0
            # nlog(n)方法：使用二分法不断更新数组
            longest = 1
            f = [float('inf') for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
            f[0] = -float('inf')
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                self.binarySearch(f, nums[i])

            for j in reversed(range(len(nums) + 1)):
                if f[j] < float('inf'):
                    longest = j
                    break
            print(f)
            return longest

        def binarySearch(self, array, num):
            start = 0
            end = len(array) - 1
            while start + 1 < end:
                mid = int((start + end) / 2)
                if array[mid] > num:
                    end = mid
                elif array[mid] < num:
                    start = mid
                else:
                    end = mid     #找到了就退出
                    break
            array[end] = num
            return array
